  abstract  = "This paper proposes an e-diagnosis system based on machine
               learning (ML) algorithms to be implemented on the Internet of
               Medical Things (IoMT) environment, particularly for diagnosing
               diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes). However, the ML
               applications tend to be mistrusted because of their inability to
               show the internal decision-making process, resulting in slow
               uptake by end-users within certain healthcare sectors. This
               research delineates the use of three interpretable supervised ML
               models: Na{\"\i}ve Bayes classifier, random forest classifier,
               and J48 decision tree models to be trained and tested using the
               Pima Indians diabetes dataset in R programming language. The
               performance of each algorithm is analyzed to determine the one
               with the best accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity.
               An assessment of the decision process is also made to improve
               the model. It can be concluded that a Na{\"\i}ve Bayes model
               works well with a more fine-tuned selection of features for
               binary classification, while random forest works better with
               more features.",
